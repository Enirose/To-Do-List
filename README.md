### Side project to practice my coding
A simple To-do app, where a user can create a task he/she wants to do. You can check or un-checked the task you are done. or even delete if you are fully done with the task you added. This To-Do app store the data in localStorage so you don't lose the task you added and still can continue with the task.

Re-created this side project to practise styling and displaying the value and saving it in local storage. A very simple project yet so fulfilling.
